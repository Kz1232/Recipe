            <h3>Making potato stuffing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Rinse and then place 3 medium sized potatoes (250 grams potatoes) in a stovetop pressure cooker.
                        Add
                        water as required just about covering the potatoes. Also add ½ teaspoon salt.

                        Pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles. When the pressure settles down on its own, then only remove
                        the
                        lid. Drain all the water.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Let the potatoes become warm. Then peel and mash them with a fork. Keep aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Now heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan or kadai. Add ⅓ cup chopped onions.</p>

                    <p>Then add ½ teaspoon ginger paste and 1 teaspoon garlic paste.</p>

                        teaspoon cumin powder.</p>

                <li>
                    <p> Mix very well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Now add the mashed potatoes in the sauteed onion mixture.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Mix potatoes very well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add 2 tablespoon of chopped coriander leaves.</p>
